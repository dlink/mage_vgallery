# Change Log

## [1.0.6] - 2016-09-08
### Added
- changelog.md, because we really should have this, so I guess it's better to start late than never...
- protected $_moduleName = 'Mage_Core'; in helper overwrite (should fix translation problems).

### Changed
- README.md updated with slightly more information.

## [1.0.5] - 2016-08-19
_Last version without a changelog._
